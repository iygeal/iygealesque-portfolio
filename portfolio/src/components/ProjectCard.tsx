/**
 * A card component for displaying project information.
 *
 * The component uses the `motion` library to animate the card
 * when it comes into view. The animation is a simple fade-in
 * from opacity 0 to 1, with a translate-y of 16px to create
 * a slight slide-in effect. The animation is triggered on the
 * `whileInView` prop and only runs once due to the `viewport`
 * prop being set to `{ once: true }`.
 *
 * The component also applies a subtle background color, a border,
 * and rounded corners to the card. The padding is set to 8px
 * and the space between elements is set to 6px.
 *
 * @param {React.ReactNode} children - The content to be rendered inside the card.
 * @returns {JSX.Element} - The rendered card component.
