          <p className="text-slate-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            I am a backend engineer focused on building reliable,
            production-ready systems. I care deeply about clean architecture,
            data integrity, and software that behaves predictably under
            real-world conditions.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Training and Experience</h2>

          <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
            I have formal training from CS50’s Web Programming with Python and
            JavaScript, where I completed and deployed multiple production-grade
            applications, including my capstone project, RightsPlace.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
            Prior to that, I spent over a year at ALX Africa, where I focused
            heavily on backend engineering, systems design, and real-world
            software practices. My experience there exposed me to leading and
            collaborating with teams, building APIs, managing databases, and
            working with deployment pipelines and server configurations.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-slate-200 font-medium">
            I have shipped systems that handle real users, real data, and real
            constraints.

          <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
            Whether working on a small API or a larger system, my goal is always
            the same: deliver software that is dependable, understandable, and
            ready for production use.
